# scPagwas

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

scPagwas, a polygenic principal component-scoring method that links scRNA-seq data with large-scale GWAS summary statistics to prioritize genetics-modulated cells associated with complex diseases.

## Installation

You can install the released version of scPagwas from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("scPagwas")
```

## Example
dengchunyu!
This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(scPagwas)
## basic example code
load(Genes_by_pathway_kegg)
data(GWAS_summ_example)
data(gtf_df)
data(scRNAexample)
data(eqtls_files)
data(chrom_ld)
#' #1. OnlyTSS
Pagwas<-Pagwas_main(Pagwas = NULL,
                    gwas_data = GWAS_summ_example,
                    add_eqtls="OnlyTSS",
                    block_annotation = gtf_df,
                    Single_data = scRNAexample,
                    Pathway_list=Genes_by_pathway.kegg,
                    chrom_ld = chrom_ld)

```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
